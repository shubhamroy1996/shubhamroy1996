## Who Am I?

I’m a developer who genuinely enjoys turning a rough idea into a tool people can actually use. For me, coding isn't just about making things work—it's about making things last.

**What I do:** I build web applications from the ground up, focusing on clean UI, smooth API integrations, and the "big picture" of how an app functions.

**My Philosophy:** I care about the details. If it doesn’t feel fast, look clean, or stay maintainable six months from now, it isn't finished.

**Currently Leveling Up:** Moving beyond the frontend to master the full stack—getting comfortable with database architecture and secure auth flows alongside my React work.

The web is always evolving, and I’m right there with it—usually experimenting with new tools or breaking things to learn how they work.

## What I'm Up To These Days
Right now, I'm diving deeper into a few things:
- **System design patterns** - figuring out how to build apps that scale without falling apart
- **Performance optimization** - making things fast isn't just nice, it actually matters for users
- **Better testing practices** - because I've been burned enough times by bugs in production
I'm also exploring serverless architectures and edge computing. The idea of running code closer to users is pretty compelling.
<br/>

## Let's Build Something
I'm always interested in working on projects that matter. Whether it's:
- An open source tool that solves a real problem
- A startup idea that needs a technical co-builder
- Anything involving complex frontend challenges

If you've got something interesting, I'd love to hear about it.

<br/>

## Things I Can Help With
If you're stuck on something, feel free to reach out. I've spent a lot of time with:

- Building apps with React.js
- Making UIs actually feel good to use
- RBAC with Dashboard and optimization
- Getting React apps to perform well

I don't claim to know everything, but I'm happy to share what I've learned.
<br/>

## Get In Touch

The best way to reach me is probably [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/shubham-kumar-dev-js/) - my DMs are open. For anything more detailed, shoot me an [email](mailto:shubham.roy1996.sr@gmail.com).

I try to respond to everyone, though it might take me a day or two if things are busy.
